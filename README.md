# Costumer-segmentation-using-affinity-propagation
Costumer segmentation was performed using the affinity propagation algorithm, PCA and autoencoders were used to optimize.

Affinity Propagation is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is particularly well suited for problems where we don't know the optimal number of clusters.
